# go-distributed🚀

Welcome to **go-distributed**, my personal playground for exploring distributed system patterns!
This repo is all about taking the examples from *Patterns of Distributed Systems* by Unmesh Joshi
and converting them from Java to Go as I dive deeper into learning the concepts.
It’s less of a “how-to” and more of a “let’s see how this goes!”🎯

## Purpose

This is a learning journey for me to better understand distributed systems by tinkering with the patterns in Go.
It’s not meant to be a perfect or definitive guide—just a fun and experimental space where I get to try things out as I learn.
If you’re curious to see what I’m up to, feel free to explore!👀
